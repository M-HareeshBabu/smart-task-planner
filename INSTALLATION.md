   ```
   c:\Unthinkable\smart-task-planner\

## Accessing the Application

2. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **You should see the Smart Task Planner interface**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Node.js is not recognized"**
   - Make sure Node.js is properly installed
   - Restart your command prompt/terminal
   - Check if Node.js is in your system PATH

2. **"npm install" fails**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try running as administrator
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

3. **Port 3000 is already in use**
   - The application runs on port 3000 by default
   - If another application is using this port, you can change it by creating a `.env` file:
   ```
   PORT=3001
   ```

4. **PowerShell execution policy errors**
   - Run PowerShell as administrator
   - Execute: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
   - Or use Command Prompt instead of PowerShell

### Getting Help:

- Check the main README.md file for detailed documentation
- Ensure all files are in the correct locations
- Verify that the `public` folder contains: index.html, styles.css, script.js
- Check that server.js and package.json are in the root directory
